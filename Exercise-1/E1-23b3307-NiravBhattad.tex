\section{Main Learnings}

This exercise helped me understand Simple Linear Regression by working directly with it. I created a set of data and figure out the $a$ and $b$ values for the simple linear regression equation. Then, by making a scatter plot and drawing the regression line, I could visualize how well the model fits the data. We'll also calculate prediction errors and use metrics like SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to check how accurate the model is.

Comparing these metrics with those from a basic model (which just predicts the average) showed why using a regression model is better. This exercise helped understand why it's important to visualize and analyze errors to understand how well the model is doing and find areas where it can be improved. In the end, I saw a practical demonstration of how theoretical regression analysis connects to real-world use, using tools like spreadsheets.
